# Used Car Price Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project explores a dataset of used car listings to understand what factors affect car prices. The original dataset contains over 3 million records from Kaggle, but this project uses a subset of 426,000 cars to enable faster processing.

The goal is to build predictive models that identify which features make a car more or less expensive, providing actionable insights to a used car dealership.

## Dataset

- Source: Kaggle (Used Car Dataset)
- Size: 426,000 car listings (subset of original 3 million)
- Features include: Age, Mileage (Odometer), Make, Model, Body Type, Transmission, Fuel Type, Title Status, Paint Color, and more.

## Approach

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and engineer polynomial features for age and odometer.
2. **Modeling:** Train Ridge and Lasso regression models with hyperparameter tuning (alpha).
3. **Evaluation:** Compare models using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²), analyze feature importance.
4. **Deployment:** Select the best model (Lasso) for a pricing tool to assist used car dealers.

## Key Findings

- Car price decreases with age, but depreciation slows for older cars.
- Body type, title status, and fuel type significantly affect price.
- Mileage negatively impacts price, but the effect lessens at higher values.
- Certain paint colors and transmission types have minor effects.

## How to Use

- Run the Jupyter Notebook to reproduce data processing, modeling, and evaluation.
- The final model is saved and can be loaded for prediction.
- A pricing tool (to be implemented separately) can use the model to estimate car prices based on input features.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn (for visualization)
